				<h2>Columbia Experimental Gravity Group (GECo)</h2>
				<p>
					The discovery of gravitational waves (GW) from binary black holes by LIGO in 2015 was a quantum leap for the field of astrophysics, and it has also excited the fundamental physics community. As predicted, the discovery also opened a new door in studying previously hidden cosmic phenomena.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our current research projects include:
					<ul>
						<li>Multimessenger searches for gravitational waves.</li>
						<li>Timing verification studies during observation runs (LIGO's timing system was Columbia's critical hardware contribution to the detectors).</li>
						<li>Application of machine learning techniques to GW detector data.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Our expertise cover multiple fronts of innovations going back to the early Initial LIGO era. 
					<ul>
					<li>We initiated the field of multimessenger astrophysics with gravitational waves and founded multimessenger efforts within LIGO in the early 2000s.</li>
					<li>Our group ran the <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.72.042002">first multimessenger search for a joint cosmic source in 2003</a>, spearheaded one of the most impactful papers of the initial LIGO era on the <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/587954/meta">origin of GRB070201</a>, and established the grassroots effort within LIGO for externally triggered searches for GWs.</li>
					<li>We pioneered multimessenger efforts with gamma-ray bursts and <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.211102">soft gamma repeaters</a>.</li>
					<li>GECo co-conceived, initiated, and co-developed the <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/25/18/184034/meta">electromagnetic followup of GW triggers</a> program for the Initial LIGO era.</li>
					</ul>
