		<h2> Challenge Problems</h2>
		<p> If you are considering working with GECo please consider solving one or more of the following challenge problems:
		<br><br>
		1. LIGO uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRIG_timecode">IRIG format</a> for timestamping its data. Given <a href="testIRIGB.csv">this 			file</a>, it contains 20second of digitized IRIG-B data taken at 16384Hz. Write a code (suggested language is python or MatLab) that prints out the 			timestamp for each second in YYYY:MM:DD HH:MM:SS format. Please check whether timestamping is correct for each consecutive second in the data. Time is 			given in <a href="https://losc.ligo.org/gps/">GPS seconds</a>.
		<br><br>
		2. Write a code (e.g. in python) that queries the json file located <a href="http://services.swpc.noaa.gov/products/noaa-scales.json">here</a> and 			prints out the NOAA scale for the likelihood of Geomagnetic storm impact for each timestamp given in the json file. If the G-scale is greater than 3 			for any of the upcoming days the code should also send out an alert message to your email address. Additional information on space weather and NOAA 			scales is <a href="http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/noaa-scales-explanation">here</a>.
		<br><br>
		3. Given <a href="GWskymap.fits.gz">this gravitational wave probability skymap</a> in the FITS file format (a standard for astronomical images). It 			uses the HEALPix pixelization format to specify pixel locations on the skymap. Please make a plot of this skymap. You can use whatever tools you want, 			but using python's healpy module is probably the easiest way to do it.
		<br><br>
		4. Write a code that queries the <a href="https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn/fermi_gbm_subthresh_archive.html">Fermi GBM subthreshold events website</a> and 		downloads the HEALPix file for the most recent event which has a 'reliability' value of 8 or greater. Update the map you created in challenge#3 with 			this map.
		<br><br>
		5. Use the fits file in challenge#3 and find a method that creates a 360 image that one can watch "from the inside" with VR glasses. We understand that 		you may not have an access to VR glasses.
